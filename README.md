# Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Motivation

Create a back-end web application which demonstrates the functinality of endpoints with Role Based Access tests.

- Coding standards: PEP8 compliant code
- Authorization: RBAC roles and JWT is implemented via the 3rd party Auth0.
- Testing: Comprehensive RBAC and error handling.
- Documentation: Setup instructions and endpoints has been documented.
- Deployment: The final code is deployed on Heroku and tests can be run agains its database.

This project is for a movie agency which has movies and actors listed in its database. There are two roles, Casting Assistant and Casting Director. For viewing the list of movies and actors in the database the user shoul be logged with the Casting Assistant role. To add, delete and modify movies the role of the user has to be Casting Director.

## Setup and dependencies

This project is based on Python3, pip and psql.

To start the project create a virtual environment in the downloaded project folder with the following bash commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env-web
source env-web/bin/activate
```

After this, install the required packages through pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are environment variables such as JWT codes and the database URL are stored in the setup.sh file. Please run this to execute.

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Following this the application endpoints are ready to be tested with the deployed server by running:

```bash
python3 test_app.py
```

##### The deployed application can be found here:

https://glistter-capstone.herokuapp.com/

##### Note: If the existing JWT's are expired new ones can be obtained by following the link on the application homepage.

1) For the Casting Director JWT, please log in with the following credentials:

- email: director@bear.com
- password: Udacity123!


2) For the Casting Assistant JWT, please login with the following credentials:

- email: assistant@bear.com
- password: Udacity123!

You'll be redirected to the main page where the JWT can be copied from the URL after the # part. Paste the JWT into the setup.sh into the CA_TOKEN and CD_TOKEN variables accordingly.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle backend requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight sqlite database.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.
